# South Bay Systems

South Bay Systems is an independent tech talk series focused on systems programming. It is entirely community-run, not affiliated with any company.

We are focused on high quality talks and expert speakers. Talks about engineering, not product pitches.

Speakers will share their experience building, debugging, testing, and maintaining:

* Compilers, parsers, virtual machines, IDEs, profiling, etc.
* Databases, storage, networking, distributed systems
* Large scale infrastructure, low latency, high availability services
* Formal methods, verification
* Browsers, kernel development, security, etc.
